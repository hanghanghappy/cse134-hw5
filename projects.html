            <p id="simplecode">Everything of my career starts off with this simple code:
                <br>
                <code>
                    cout << "Hello World!\n"; 
                </code>

                Here is a list of projects that I have done:
                <pre>
                    The projects listed first are the latest ones completed, so in this case:
                    (Latest) Ride-sharing App   ---   Mood Tracking App   ---   News App (Oldest)
                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Ride-sharing App</h3>
                        <p>
                            This application is for a cheaper option comparing to current ones. This one is designed
                            especially for students. Students who commute to school by car can also share rides to those
                            who require the service. The drivers can earn money to cover up their expenses to commute
                            while riders can have a cheaper option to commute.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Mood Tracking App</h3>
                        <p>
                            This application is for users to track their mood daily. They can rate their mood that day which is represented by
                             a color that they can view the trend of their mood in the calender afterward. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>News App</h3>
                        <p>
                            This application is to gather all news based on an algorithm which calculates the views to determine its importance.
